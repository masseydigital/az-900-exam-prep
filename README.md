## Cloud Benefits

### High Availability
_High availability_ is an agreed upon characteristic to ensure level of operational performance (uptime)

_Availability_ itself refers to the ability of end users to actually access the system and to complete a task.

A _load balancer_ is one example of a resource that provides high availability.

_Azure Load Balancers_ provide high availability for services, support inbound and outbound scenarios, provide low latency and throughput, and scale up to millions of flows for all TCP and UDP applications.

### Scalability
_Scalability refers to the idea oof a system in which every app or piece of infrastructure can be expanded to support increased workflows. i.e. a web application that goes from having a few users to a hundred thousand users.

There are four general areas that scalability can refer to:
1) Disk I/O
2) CPU
3) Memory
4) Network I/O

There are two main ways of scaling an application:
1) Horizontal (wide): adding more resources to an existing instance, i.e. adding a server and implementing a load balancer.  Scaling out is generally considered more difficult due to the maintenance of updates, security settings, etc. for multiple hardware components.
2) Vertical (up): adding more power to an existing instance, i.e. adding more memory, faster storage, more powerful cpu, etc.

_Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets_ are one example of scaling that Azure provides as part of the service offering.

### Elasticity
_Elasticity_ refers to the ability to scale up and then scale back down.  Elasticity helps ensure you are using the resources you need, and effective management of resources saves you money.

Azure allows you to auto-scale resources by setting thresholds for traffic, what resources to provision, and how long to re-evaluate the thresholds.

### Agility
_Agility_ is the ability to rapidly change infrastructure requirements to meet operational needs.  With Azure and other cloud resources, companies can rapidly adjust their infrastructure to conceive, plan, and deploy applications within days.

### Fault Tolerance
_Fault Tolerance_ refers to the ability of an infrastructure to continue providing service after one or more of its components have failed.

Azure provides several _availability sets_ which allow the virtual machines and other resources to be distributed across different servers, computer racks, storage units, and network switches.

### Disaster Recovery
_Disaster Recovery_ refers to recovering from a catastrophic loss of application functionality.

Azure provides _resource groups_ across _regions_ which help with ensuring that natural disasters do not take down your application.

Azure provides the _Azure Site Recovery Service_ to ensure continuity of business apps and workloads running during outages.

### Capital Expenditures (CapEx) vs Operational Expenditures (OpEx)
_Capital Expenditures_ refers to money that a company spends towards fixed assets
i.e. Property, Plant, or Equipment (PP&E)
Generally one-time purchases

_Operational Expenditures_ refers to money that a company uses to run day to day operations.  They are usually used within the year of purchase.
Includes consumables such as printer cartridges, paper, and electricity.  Also maintenance agreements, web site hosting, and web domain registrations.

## As-a-Service Offerings

### Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)
Infrastructure as a service is having instant computing resources that can be scaled up or down depending on your requirements.  Infrastructure are servers, switches, and other computing resources that are needed to run some software.  IaaS is usually used in scenarios where you want to test and develop new methodologies since you can quickly gain necessary resources until you can figure out what you need.  It also helps with website hosting and storage backup, and recovery.  

Benefits of IaaS:
1) Eliminates capital expenditure and reduces ongoing cost by providing leased services and only what the company needs.
2) Improves business continuity and disaster recovery through use of recovery services and multiple regions.
3) Allows organizations to innovate rapidly by providing services immediately
4) Allows businesses to shift more quickly to emerging business conditions, and focus on core business.
5) Increases stability, reliability, and supportability

When to use IaaS:
1) You are a startup or small company
2) You are a large organization looking to move away from on-premise hardware
3) You are a rapidly growing company; unsure of infrastructure needs

### Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a complete development environment in the cloud.  It includes servers, storage, and networking, but also includes middle-ware such as OS's.

It is designed to support the complete web application life cycle, avoid the expense of buying and managing software licenses, and gives you the ability to manage applications and services while the cloud provider manages the provisioning.

Common PaaS scenarios include:
1) Development Framework: provides framework developers can use to create cloud based applications.
2) Analytics and Business Intelligence: 
3) Additional Services

Advantages of PaaS:
1) Cuts coding time from built-in services
2) Add development capabilities without adding staff
3) Develop for multiple platforms more easily
4) Use sophisticated tools more affordable
5) Can support geographically distributed development teams
6) Efficiently manage application life cycle through built-in services
 
When to use PaaS:
1) Multiple developers/teams working on the same project
2) Wish to be able to create your own customized applications
3) Rapidly prototyping or deploying an application

### Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
Software as a Services (SaaS) allows users to connect to and use cloud based apps over the network.  SaaS provides a complete software solution that can be accessed over the internet.  i.e. Webmail, Calendars, Collaboration etc.

Advantages of using SaaS:
1) Gain access to sophisticated applications
2) Pay only for what you use
3) Use free client software
4) Mobilize workforce more easily
5) Access app data from anywhere

### Private Cloud
Used for resources exclusively by one business or organization.  Can be physically located at organization's on-site data center, or can be hosted by a third-party service provider. Private clouds are generally located on-premise.  Private cloud is more secure than public cloud since security requirements are defined by the organization.

### Hybrid Cloud
The hybrid cloud is the best of both worlds.  It utilizes both on-prem and public clouds.  Data and apps can move between private and public clouds.  _Cloud bursting_ allows applications to "burst" into public cloud when demand rises above a threshold.

## Core Azure Architectural Components

### Azure Regions
An _azure region_ is a set of data centers that are connected within a latency-defined perimeter network.  As of this tutorial, there are 42 regions around the world with an additional 12 announced.  _Azure Geographies_ are areas of the world that contain at least one Azure Region.  _Regional Pairs_ are two regions that are connected in the same geography.  This allows Azure to provide updates that do not shut down a region.  At least one region in each pair will be prioritized for recovery.  

### Availability Zones
_Azure Availability Zones_ are one or more physical locations within an Azure Region that provides independent power, cooling, and networking.  There are a minimum of (3) separate zones in all enabled regions.  The purpose of this is to protect applications from datacenter failures.

### Resource Groups
An _Azure Resource Group_ holds related resources for an Azure solution.  Developers choose which resource group resources go into.  Each resource can only exist in one resource group.

Best practices for resource groups:
1) All resources should share the same life cycle
2) Use resource groups to scope access control

_Azure Resource Manager_ enables you to work with resources in a group. It provides security, auditing, and tagging features.

_Resource_ A single service provided by Azure.

_Resource Group_ A container of resources

_Resource Provider_ provide operations for working with resources that get deployed.  i.e. Microsoft.Compute

_Resource Manager Templates_ are JSON files that define deployment procedures for resources

_Declarative Syntax_ is easily understood terminology for deploying resources (not the code needed)
